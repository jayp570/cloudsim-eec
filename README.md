Each algorithm is a different branch in the repository. The current branch, main, is simply the starter code provided to us. Please go to the other branches to see our scheduling algorithms.

Algorithms
1. Greedy
2. PMapper
3. E-Eco
4. Load Balanced Power Saving

This is the repository for the Cloud Simulator project for CS 378. To run this project, you can compile the Scheduler with `make scheduler` and run `make simulator` to create your simulator executable. Run `./simulator Input.md` to see your results.

For questions, please reach out to any of the course staff on via email (anish.palakurthi@utexas.edu, tarun.mohan@utexas.edu, mootaz@austin.utexas.edu) or Ed Discussion.
